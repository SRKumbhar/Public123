      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Electronics Committee also known as the "Bhabha Committee" created a 10-year (1966–1975) plan laying the foundation for India's IT Service Industries.[10] The industry was born in Mumbai in 1967 with the establishment of Tata Consultancy Services[11] who in 1977 partnered with Burroughs which began India's export of IT services.[12] The first software export zone, SEEPZ – the precursor to the modern-day IT park – was established in Mumbai in 1973. More than 80 percent of the country's software exports were from SEEPZ in the 1980s.</p>

      <h2>Job Opportunities</h2>
     <p>Information technology has entered and benefited all sectors of industry. IT professionals design, support, and maintain computer hardware and software for various industrial and individual applications and are much sought after for their expertise and experience.

The National Association of Software and Service Companies has predicted a 12 percent increase in Indian software exports in 2015-16 to $112 billion. Probably, the only, or at least the biggest, hurdle in the country achieving this growth rate is the shortage of skilled and competent IT professionals.</p>
